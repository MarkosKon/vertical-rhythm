      <h1>Orbs, stars, and twilights</h1>
      <p class="intro">
        A peep at some distant orb has power to raise and purify our thoughts
        like a strain of sacred music, or a noble picture, or a passage from the
        grander poets. It always does 1 good.
      </p>
      <h2>Illusions</h2>
      <p>
        Apparently we had reached a great height in the atmosphere (
        <span class="fraction">1/2</span>), for the
        <span class="small-caps">sky</span> was a dead black, and the stars had
        ceased to twinkle. By the same illusion which lifts the horizon of the
        sea to the level of the spectator on a hillside, the sable cloud beneath
        was dished out, and the car seemed to float in the middle of an immense
        dark sphere, whose upper half was strewn with silver. The efficient
        office for ligature testing.
      </p>
      <h3>Velocity</h3>
      <p>
        As I went on, still gaining velocity, the palpitation of night and day
        merged into one continuous greyness; the sky took on a wonderful
        deepness of blue, a splendid luminous color like that of early twilight;
        the jerking sun became a streak of fire, a brilliant arch, in space; the
        moon a fainter fluctuating band; and I could see nothing of the stars,
        save now and then a brighter circle flickering in the blue.

          I shall see the face of Mars, anyhow, and that will be a rare
          experience.
        </li>
        <li>
          It seems to me that a view of the heavenly bodies through a fine
          telescope,
        </li>
        <li>
          as well as a tour round the world, should form a part of a liberal
          education.

      <h4>The face of Mars</h4>
      <p>
        Though the gravity still dragged at him, his muscles were making great
        efforts to adjust. After the daily classes he no longer collapsed
        immediately into bed. Only the nightmares got worse.
